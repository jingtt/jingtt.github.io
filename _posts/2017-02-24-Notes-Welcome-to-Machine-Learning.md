# What is machine learning?

- Every time you use a web search engine like Google or Bing to search the Internet, one of the reasons that works so well is because a learning algorithm, one implemented by Google or Microsoft, has learned how to rank web pages.
- Every time you read your email and your spam filter saves you from having to wade through tons of spam emails (email anti-spam), that is also machine learning. 
- AI dream of somebody building machines as intelligent as you. Many AI researchers believe that the best way is through learning algorithms that try to mimic how the human brain learns.

Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

# Why is machine learning so prevalent today?

It turns out that the machine learning is a field that had grown out of the field of AI. There are a few basic things that we could program a machine to do such as how to find the shortest path from A to B. But for the most part we just did not know how to write AI programs to do the more interesting things such as web search or email anti-spam or photo tagging. There was a realization that the only way to do these things was to have a machine learn to do it by itself. 

Machine learning was developed as a new capability for computers and today it touches many segments of industry and basic science. 

Examples:

- Database mining

  (Web click data) One of the reasons machine learning has been so prevalent is the growth of the web and the growth of automation. All this means that we have much larger data sets than ever before. For example tons of Silicon Valley companies are today collecting web click data, also called clickstream data, and are trying to use machine learning algorithms to mine this data to understand the users better and to serve the users better.

  (Medical records) With the advent of automation, we now have electronic medical records, so if  we can turn medical records into medical knowledge, then we can start to understand disease better. 

  (Computational biology) With automation again, biologists are collecting lots of data about gene sequences, DNA sequences, and so on. Machine learning algorithms are giving us much better a understanding of the human genome, and what is means to be human.

- Applications cannot program by hand

  (Autonomous helicopter) Scientists do not know how to write a computer program to make this helicopter fly by itself. The only thing that worked was having a computer learn by itself how to fly this helicopter. 

  (Handwriting recognition) It turns out one of the reasons it's so inexpensive today to route a piece of mail across the countries is that when you write an envelope like this, it turns out there's a learning algorithm that has learned how to read your handwriting so that it can automatically route this envelope on its way. So it costs us a few cents to send this thing thousands of miles.

  (Natural Language Processing, NLP)

  (Computer Vision)

- Self-customizing programs

  Every time you go to Amazon, it recommends the products to you. 

- Understanding human learning (brain, real AI)
