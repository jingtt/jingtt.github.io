My name is Jing Xuan. I recently graduated from National University of Singapore with my master's degree, my major is quantitative finance. The field I studied is mainly about financial modelling, portfolio management and risk management. I received my bachelor's degree from Southeast University, majored in mathematics and applied mathematics.



From last November to this January, I worked as a data mining intern at Ping An Technology, assisted in developing credit scorecard models.  

We use the data from diverse sources to predict, to recognize companies that might default in the future. What I do is using some probability and statistical method to check the validity of risk factors, so we can select most important factors to build our regression model. I also wrote the model document and wrote some data processing scripts with Python and SQL.



From last August to last November, I worked as a machine learning intern at Philips research data. My work is to analyze clinical data.



The projects in my master's period is mainly about the pricing of financial products and I did all the modelling and coding work in these projects and most codes are written in Matlab. 



I am a quick-learner and self-motivated. In my free time, I also learned some open online courses.
